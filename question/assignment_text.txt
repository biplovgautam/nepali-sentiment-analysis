Overview and Purpose

This individual coursework is designed to assess your understanding of the module’s core
concepts by having your design, implement, and evaluate an AI model to solve a realworld problem. You are required to apply algorithmic techniques discussed in class and
demonstrate problem-solving, experimentation, and critical thinking.
You will create an AI-driven solution using one or more algorithms in the domains of:
• Classification
• Clustering
• Recommendation Systems
• Search Techniques
• Constraint Satisfaction Problems
Key Tasks and Deliverables

Each student must complete the following:
1. Topic Selection & Problem Definition
a. Choose a topic aligned with one of the AI problem domains.
b. Coordinate the topic with your Module Leader for approval.
c. Clearly define the problem and justify its relevance and impact.
2. Data Collection & Preprocessing
a. Identify and source a suitable dataset.
b. Explain your data preprocessing steps: cleaning, normalization, feature
selection, etc.
3. Model Design
a. Choose an appropriate AI algorithm from the module.
b. Provide justification for your algorithm selection.
c. Design and implement the solution using custom-defined data structures,
functions, or classes where appropriate.
4. Training & Evaluation
a. Train the model and test it using standard practices.
b. Evaluate performance using relevant metrics (accuracy, F1 score,
precision, recall, RMSE, etc.).
c. Include a comparative analysis if multiple models or approaches are
tested.
5. Interface Development
a. Develop a CLI or GUI to demonstrate your project.
b. The interface should allow users to interact with the model in a meaningful
way (e.g., predict, search, recommend).
6. Version Control
a. You must use GitHub Classroom for source code management.
b. Commit code frequently with meaningful messages.
7. Report Writing
a. A final 4000-word report must include:
i. Abstract and introduction
ii. Literature review of related AI work
iii. Problem description and methodology
iv. Algorithm and implementation details
v. Data collection and preprocessing
vi. Experimental results and analysis
vii. Conclusion and future improvements
viii. Proper APA 7th referencing throughout
8. Video Demonstration
a. A 10-minute video demonstrating:

i. Problem overview
ii. Code and interface walkthrough
iii. Model in action
iv. Brief explanation of results
9. Viva Session
a. Each student will defend their work through a 15-20-minute individual viva.
b. You may be asked to run your code, explain design decisions, and discuss
evaluation results
c. Questions will be based on the coursework and/or topics covered in class

Note:
1. Students are strongly encouraged to utilize their own custom-defined data
structures, function or class wherever possible instead of relying on the built-in
data structures, functions or classes provided by the programming language.
2. You are expected to use the APA 7th style for referencing. For support and advice
on this, students can contact the Centre for Academic Writing (CAW).
3. Please notify your registry course support team and module leader for disability
support.

4. The University is not liable for any loss or corruption of coursework stored on
disks, laptops, or personal computers. It is essential for students to frequently back
up their work and are advised to save it in the University system.
5. If there are technical or performance issues that prevent students submitting
coursework through the online coursework submission system on the day of a
coursework deadline, an appropriate extension to the coursework submission
deadline will be agreed. This extension will normally be 24 hours or the next
working day if the deadline falls on a Friday or over the weekend period. This will
be communicated via your Module Leader.
6. Collusion between students (where sections of your work are like the work
submitted by other students in this or previous module cohorts) is taken extremely
seriously and will be reported to the academic conduct panel. This applies to both
coursework and exam answers.
7. If there is a significant contrast in the writing style, knowledge, and skill level
exhibited between your class discussions, test conditions, and a coursework
assignment, it may be necessary for you to participate in an in-person
examination. The purpose of this examination would be to confirm that the
coursework assignment has been solely completed by you.
8. If you make use of the services of a proof-reader in your work, you must keep your
original version and make it available as a demonstration of your written efforts.
9. It is strictly prohibited to submit work for assessment that has already been
submitted, either partially or in its entirety, for your current course or any other
qualification offered by the college. However, in the case of resits, you may be
asked to revise and enhance a previous attempt for the coursework. The specific
guidelines regarding this requirement will be outlined in your assignment brief or
provided within the course or module information. If you are referencing earlier
work that has been previously published or submitted, it must be cited clearly.
Submitting identical pieces of work concurrently can also be considered as selfplagiarism.
