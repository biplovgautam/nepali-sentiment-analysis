##  Project Overview

This project implements a **financial sentiment analysis system** using supervised learning techniques, specifically focusing on **Naive Bayes classification**. The system analyzes financial text data to classify sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral, providing valuable insights for financial decision-making and market analysis.

### üìä Dataset Information

- **Source**: [Financial Sentiment Analysis Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sbhatti/financial-sentiment-analysis) from Kaggle
- **Original Size**: 5,842 financial text samples
- **Classes**: Positive, Negative, Neutral sentiment labels
- **Domain**: Financial news, reports, and market communications
- **Format**: CSV file with 'Sentence' and 'Sentiment' columns

### üîç Key Findings from EDA

- **Data Quality**: No null values or duplicate entries
-  **Class Imbalance**: Significant imbalance (Neutral: 53.6%, Positive: 31.7%, Negative: 14.7%)
-  **Text Characteristics**: Average 117 characters per sentence (range: 9-315)
-  **Financial Context**: Rich presence of financial terms (EUR, million, company, sales)
-  **Numeric Content**: Abundant financial figures requiring standardization

##  Preprocessing Strategies Applied

### 1. Class Balancing Strategy
**Problem**: Severe class imbalance (ratio: 3.64) affecting model training
**Solution**: 
- **Neutral Class**: Reduced from 3,130 ‚Üí 1,200 samples (kept longest texts for quality)
- **Positive Class**: Reduced from 1,852 ‚Üí 1,200 samples (kept longest texts for quality)
- **Negative Class**: Retained all 860 samples (minority class)
- **Result**: Improved imbalance ratio from 3.64 ‚Üí 1.40 (62% improvement)


### 2. Preprocessing Achievements
-  **Text Standardization**: All numeric values converted to `<NUM>` tokens
- **Domain Preservation**: Financial symbols ($, %, EUR) maintained for context
-  **Consistency**: Uniform lowercase formatting and whitespace normalization
-  **Noise Removal**: URLs and unnecessary special characters eliminated
-  **Balanced Dataset**: Final dataset with 3,260 high-quality samples

### 3. Validation Results
- **Class Balance**: 62% improvement in imbalance ratio
- **Vocabulary Optimization**: Reduced vocabulary while preserving financial terminology
- **Numeric Consistency**: Standardized numeric representation with `<NUM>` tokens
- **Data Integrity**: No loss of essential financial context during transformation
