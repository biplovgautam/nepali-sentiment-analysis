## Chapter 1: Introduction

### 1.1 Background and Motivation

**Context:**
Financial sentiment analysis has become increasingly critical in modern financial markets, where automated systems process vast amounts of financial news, reports, and communications to extract actionable insights. The ability to accurately classify financial text as positive, negative, or neutral enables better investment decisions, risk assessment, and market analysis.

**Real-world Application:**
- Financial institutions use sentiment analysis for algorithmic trading
- Investment firms analyze market sentiment from news articles
- Risk management systems assess sentiment in financial reports
- Regulatory bodies monitor market sentiment for stability analysis

**Motivation:**
This project addresses the need for accurate, automated financial sentiment classification using machine learning techniques specifically tailored for financial domain text, which contains unique terminology, numerical data, and domain-specific language patterns.

### 1.2 Problem Statement and Scope

**Primary Problem:**
Develop an AI-powered system that can accurately classify financial text sentiment into three categories (positive, negative, neutral) while handling domain-specific challenges such as:
- Class imbalance in financial datasets
- Financial terminology and numeric data
- Contextual meaning of financial language

**Scope:**
- Focus on English financial text classification
- Use supervised learning approach (Naive Bayes)
- Address class imbalance through data balancing techniques
- Develop web-based interface for practical deployment
- Evaluate performance using standard classification metrics

**Limitations:**
- Limited to three sentiment classes
- English language only
- Focused on formal financial text (not social media)

### 1.3 Objectives

**Primary Objective:**
Build a robust financial sentiment analysis system using Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier with TF-IDF vectorization.

**Specific Goals:**
1. Implement comprehensive data preprocessing pipeline for financial text
2. Address class imbalance through intelligent data balancing
3. Train and optimize Naive Bayes model for financial sentiment classification

## Chapter 3: Methodology

### 3.1 Dataset and Preprocessing

**Dataset Information:**
- **Source**: Financial Sentiment Analysis Dataset from Kaggle
- **Original Size**: 5,842 financial text samples
- **Features**: 2 columns (Sentence, Sentiment)
- **Classes**: Positive, Negative, Neutral
- **Domain**: Financial news, reports, market communications

**Data Quality Assessment:**
```
✅ Complete dataset: No null values or duplicates
✅ Appropriate text length: Average 117 characters (range: 9-315)
✅ Rich financial terminology: EUR, $, %, company names, financial metrics
⚠️ Class imbalance: Neutral (53.6%), Positive (31.7%), Negative (14.7%)
```

**Preprocessing Pipeline:**

1. **Initial Data Analysis**
   - Text length distribution analysis
   - Class distribution visualization
   - Financial symbol pattern analysis
   - Word cloud generation for each sentiment class

2. **Class Balancing Strategy**
   ```python
   # Phase 1: Initial balancing
   Neutral: 3,130 → 1,200 samples (kept longest texts)
   Positive: 1,852 → 1,200 samples (kept longest texts)  
   Negative: 860 → 860 samples (retained all)
   Result: Improved imbalance ratio from 3.64 → 1.40
   
   # Phase 2: Full balancing (for improved model)
   All classes: → 1,200 samples each
   Method: Intelligent duplication of longest negative sentences
   ```

3. **Text Preprocessing Function**
   ```python
   def preprocess_financial_text(text):
       # Remove URLs
       # Replace numbers with <NUM> tokens
       # Convert to lowercase
       # Preserve financial symbols ($, %, EUR)
       # Clean special characters
       # Normalize whitespace
   ```

4. **Dataset Splitting**
   - Training: 80% (stratified sampling)
   - Testing: 20% (stratified sampling)
   - Random state: 42 (reproducibility)

### 3.2 Algorithm Explanation

**Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier**

**Mathematical Foundation:**
```
P(class|text) = P(text|class) × P(class) / P(text)

Where:
- P(class|text): Posterior probability of class given text
- P(text|class): Likelihood of text given class
- P(class): Prior probability of class
- P(text): Evidence (normalization factor)
```

**Algorithm Steps:**
1. **Training Phase:**
   - Calculate class priors: P(class) = count(class) / total_samples
   - Calculate feature likelihoods: P(word|class) with Laplace smoothing
   - Store class and feature probabilities

2. **Prediction Phase:**
   - Vectorize input text using TF-IDF
   - Calculate posterior probabilities for each class
   - Return class with highest probability

**TF-IDF Vectorization:**
```
TF-IDF(word) = TF(word) × IDF(word)
TF(word) = word_count / total_words
IDF(word) = log(total_documents / documents_containing_word)
```

**Example Calculation:**
```
Text: "company profit increased by <NUM>%"
Classes: [positive, negative, neutral]

For positive class:
P(positive|text) ∝ P(company|positive) × P(profit|positive) × 
                   P(increased|positive) × P(<NUM>|positive) × 
                   P(%|positive) × P(positive)
```

### 3.3 Justification for Algorithm Choice

**Why Multinomial Naive Bayes:**

1. **Text Classification Suitability:**
   - Designed for discrete features (word counts)
   - Handles high-dimensional sparse data efficiently
   - Strong baseline for text classification tasks

2. **Financial Domain Advantages:**
   - Fast training and prediction (important for real-time applications)
   - Interpretable results (can analyze which words drive sentiment)
   - Robust to irrelevant features (common in financial text)
   - Works well with limited training data

3. **Comparison with Alternatives:**
   
   | Algorithm | Accuracy | Training Time | Interpretability | Memory Usage |
   |-----------|----------|---------------|------------------|--------------|
   | Naive Bayes | Good | Fast | High | Low |
   | SVM | Higher | Slow | Medium | High |
   | Random Forest | Good | Medium | Medium | Medium |
   | Deep Learning | Highest | Very Slow | Low | Very High |

4. **Project Context:**
   - Academic assignment focusing on traditional ML
   - Limited computational resources
   - Need for interpretable results
   - Real-time deployment requirements

**Strengths in Our Context:**
- Handles class imbalance reasonably well
- Efficient with TF-IDF sparse matrices
- Suitable for financial text patterns
- Easy to deploy in web applications

**Limitations:**
- Strong independence assumption between features
- Can be outperformed by ensemble methods
- Sensitive to class imbalance (addressed through data balancing)

### 3.4 Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning

**TF-IDF Vectorizer Parameters:**
```python
TfidfVectorizer(
    max_features=10000,     # Vocabulary size limit
    min_df=2,               # Ignore rare terms
    max_df=0.95,            # Ignore too common terms
    ngram_range=(1, 2),     # Unigrams and bigrams
    stop_words='english',   # Remove stop words
    lowercase=True,         # Normalize case
    strip_accents='ascii'   # Handle accents
)
```

**Naive Bayes Parameters:**
```python
MultinomialNB(
    alpha=1.0,              # Laplace smoothing
    fit_prior=True,         # Learn class priors
    class_prior=None        # Use training data for priors
)
```

**Parameter Selection Process:**
1. **Manual Testing**: Started with default parameters
2. **Validation**: Used classification reports for evaluation
3. **Optimization**: Focused on balanced performance across classes

**Hyperparameter Analysis:**
- **Alpha (smoothing)**: Tested values [0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0]
  - Result: α=1.0 provided best balance
- **N-gram range**: Compared (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)
  - Result: (1,2) optimal for financial text
- **Max features**: Tested 5K, 10K, 15K, 20K
  - Result: 10K provided best accuracy/efficiency trade-off
